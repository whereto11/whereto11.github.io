The following is my goal of learning computer.
Understand the Fundamentals: Gain a solid understanding of the basic concepts and principles of computer science, such as algorithms, data structures, programming languages, and computer architecture.
Develop Programming Skills: Learn to code in one or more programming languages, and become proficient in writing efficient and well-structured code. Practice solving problems and implementing algorithms.
Explore Different Domains: Explore various domains within computer science, such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, data science, software engineering, and web development, to identify areas of interest and potential career paths.
Build Practical Projects: Apply theoretical knowledge by working on practical projects. Develop software applications, websites, or other computer-based solutions to gain hands-on experience and showcase your skills.
Collaborate and Network: Engage in collaborative coding projects, participate in coding competitions, and join computer science communities to network with like-minded individuals, share knowledge, and learn from others.
Stay Updated with Technology: Keep up with the rapidly evolving field of computer science by staying updated with the latest technologies, trends, and advancements. Continuously learn new programming languages, frameworks, and tools to adapt to industry demands.
Problem-Solving Skills: Enhance problem-solving abilities by practicing algorithmic thinking, logical reasoning, and critical analysis. Learn techniques to break down complex problems into manageable parts and develop efficient solutions.
Gain Professional Experience: Seek internships, part-time jobs, or volunteer opportunities in the computer science field to gain practical experience, apply classroom knowledge in real-world scenarios, and develop professional skills.
Continuous Learning: Embrace a lifelong learning mindset in the ever-changing field of computer science. Stay curious, explore new areas, and pursue advanced studies or certifications to deepen your expertise and stay relevant.
Contribute to Open Source: Contribute to open-source projects to collaborate with developers worldwide, improve your coding skills, and give back to the community by sharing your knowledge and expertise.

A data-driven personal website
======
under construction......

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
